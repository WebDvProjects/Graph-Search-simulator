THINGS TO FIX:

TODO:
Improve UI
Add Key
User pick start and end positions by clicking on grid
Add other algorithms or variants (Traditional Iteration, Djikstra's shortest path)
Skip to end button (The idea is to stop clearGrid (which also stops all timeouts) then re-execute the function without timeouts)
pause and play buttons
