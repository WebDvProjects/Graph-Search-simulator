BUGS:
On mobile the dragging/drawing effect for the walls can get a bit buggy cz the touchmove events
trigger so often that sometimes it unselects the walls immediately

TODO:
Improve UI
Add Key
///user pick start and end positions by clicking on grid
/Add other algorithms or variants (Traditional Iteration, Djikstra's shortest path)
Skip to end button (The idea is to stop clearGrid (which also stops all timeouts) then re-execute the function without timeouts)
pause and play buttons
///store the nodes as node objects to make it easy to calculate distances and also easier to read. (For A* and Dijkstra)

///PATHFINDING (MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A MAZE)

add greedy tuning UI option for the A* algorithm

Show algorithms illustrations simultaneously

///animation speed setting

make cell event listeners separate functions so that code is easier to read

stop user form selecting start and end nodes when the animation is running unless they clear or stop the animation

///only validate input when user is inserting values in the form otherwise have the user pick the start and target nodes straight from the grid

fixed-grid size



BFS


Dijkstra
Uses weights(such as distance) that each node has from the soource
to find the shortest path (the weights could be adjusted to meet fctors and constraints)
Uses more computational power and memory in comparison to BFS
In this application the weights are 1 unit for each node so its better to use
BFS over Dijkstra as its faster than dijkstra
